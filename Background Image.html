<p> Documenting what you eat tells your friends a lot about who you are--your habits, personality, preferences and culinary weaknesses. If this sounds like you, it's likely that you've already become a fan of "Taking Pictures of Food." </p>
<p>Food is one of the necessities of life. Food contains nutrientsâ€”substances essential for the growth, repair, and maintenance of body tissues and for the regulation of vital processes. Nutrients provide the energy our bodies need to function. The energy in food is measured in units called calories.Inaugurated by Andy Warhol's famous Campbell's Soup series, food and drink has played a pivotal role in modern art. Often seen as a critique on consumerism and consumer culture, images featuring mass-produced food have been a mainstay of contemporary artists around the world. </p>
<p> Printed pictures are incredibly important as they not only allow us to capture a certain moment in time, but also preserve it for generations to come and so are able to relive the wonderful memory or experience again and again</p>
